Define a struct IntArray that keeps a C array of integers and its size.
Define a function map that takes an IntArray and a Unary Operation
	f (takes one int, returns one int) and returns an IntArray
	where f was applied on each element in the array.
Define a function filter that takes an IntArray and a Predicate (takes an
	int returns true or false) and returns an IntArray
	that contains only the elements of the original one that statisfy
	the predicate.
Demonstrate the usage of these functions using lambdas (see Prison.cpp
	from exercise 01) (You will also have to write a printfuntion
	for IntArray).
